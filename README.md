## About the Bootcamp
The Software engineering bootcamp by HyperionDev is structured to allow you to start coding as soon as possible. 
Tasks are designed to teach you the theory needed to develop your skills, and give you the opportunity to practice implementing your newly acquired Python and machine learning knowledge by completing practical activities.

## Projects
In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that I completed during the bootcamp. 
Each project demonstrates my ability to apply the concepts and skills I learned.

## Technologies
During the bootcamp, I had the opportunity to work with a range of technologies, including but not limited to:
- Programming Languages: Python, HTML, CSS, SQL
- Tools and Frameworks: Bootstrap, Django, Git, github

Feel free to explore the individual project and exercise directories for more details on the specific technologies used for each.
